    <h1>About The Weather Spectrum</h1>

    <div class="mission">
        <strong>Our Mission:</strong> To provide accessible, accurate weather information and innovative tools that help people understand and prepare for weather events affecting their communities.
    </div>

    <h2>What We Do</h2>
    <p>The Weather Spectrum is a comprehensive weather information platform offering real-time forecasts, severe weather alerts, and interactive visualization tools. We bridge the gap between complex meteorological data and everyday users who need practical weather information.</p>

    <p>Unlike paid weather services, we believe critical weather information should be freely accessible to everyone. Our platform aggregates data from trusted sources like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the National Weather Service, presenting it in user-friendly formats that anyone can understand.</p>

    <h2>Our Tools and Features</h2>
    <div class="features">

        <div class="feature-box">
            <h3>📱 Weather Notifications</h3>
